# Publish artifacts of React Native dependencies to S3

The main purpose of this repository is to ease the process of adding and upgrading the React Native dependencies of Gutenberg, specifically, the part the related to publishing the artifacts of the Android libraries of the dependencies.

**For now, this repository only supports dependencies that donâ€™t have a forked repository, so when adding a package note that we can only use versions from the NPM registry (e.g. `"react-native-get-random-values": "1.4.0"`).**

**NOTE:** This setup might not work for all dependencies. In the future, it might require further modifications to get new packages published.

## How to publish an artifact of a dependency

### When it's a new package
1. Add the package to the `devDependencies` section of the [`package.json` file](./package.json).

**Example:**
`"react-native-get-random-values": "1.4.0"`

2. Add the Android project of the dependency to the [`settings.gradle.kts` file](./settings.gradle.kts).

**Example:**
```
include(":react-native-get-random-values")
project(":react-native-get-random-values").projectDir = File(rootProject.projectDir, "node_modules/react-native-get-random-values/android")
```

3. Add the name of the Android project to the `PROJECTS` array of [`.buildkite/publish-libraries.sh` file](.buildkite/publish-libraries.sh).
4. Run command `npm install` to install the new package.
5. Push the changes to a branch and create a PR.
6. Wait for the `buildkite/react-native-libraries-publisher/publish-to-s3` PR check to succeed.

### When upgrading a package
1. Update the version of the package in the [`package.json` file](package.json).
2. Run command `npm install` to install the specified version of the package.
3. Push the changes to a branch and create a PR.
4. Wait for the `buildkite/react-native-libraries-publisher/publish-to-s3` PR check to succeed.

## How to include the artifact in Gutenberg

If you're introducing a new package:
1. Add the package as new dependency into [the `package.json` file of `react-native-editor` in Gutenberg](https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/blob/trunk/packages/react-native-editor/package.json).
2. Run command `npm install` within the Gutenberg project.

Once the package is added as a dependency, or if it was already included, add a `implementation` statement referencing the package into the following files in Gutenberg:

- `packages/react-native-bridge/android/react-native-bridge/build.gradle`
- `packages/react-native-editor/android/app/build.gradle`

**Example**:
```
implementation "org.wordpress-mobile:react-native-get-random-values:${extractPackageVersion(packageJson, 'react-native-get-random-values', 'dependencies')}"
```

**NOTE:** The version of the artifact will be extracted from the `package.json` file of the package.
